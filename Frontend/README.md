## üéÆ Video Game eCommerce Website

### Description

This is a fully functional video game eCommerce platform designed for users to browse, search, and purchase their favorite games. The site features a sleek interface with categorized game sections, a wishlist, a dynamic shopping cart, user authentication, and a demo checkout system.

Users can explore new and popular games, filter by platform and genre, and manage their cart and wishlist seamlessly. The platform is powered by the RAWG API for fetching game details and includes custom pricing rules to simulate a real-world store experience.

## Purpose of the Project

I created this project as part of my portfolio to demonstrate my skills in full-stack web development, including:

- Frontend development with React for creating a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- Backend development with Node.js and Express for building APIs and managing authentication.
- Integration with third-party APIs like RAWG for fetching real-time game data.
- Database management with MongoDB for user authentication and wishlist persistence.
- Implementing secure user authentication and authorization with JWT.
- State management using React Context for the cart and wishlist features.
- This project showcases my ability to build and deploy full-stack web applications and highlights my skills in problem-solving, API integration, and user experience design.
